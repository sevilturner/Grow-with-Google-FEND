 * Programming Quiz: JuliaJames (4-1)
	***Directions:
	Write a while loop that:

	Loop through the numbers 1 to 20
	If the number is divisible by 3, print "Julia"
	If the number is divisible by 5, print "James"
	If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "JuliaJames"
	If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number
	
	TIP: A number x is divisible by a number y if the answer to x / y has a remainder of 0. 
	For example, 10 is divisible by 2 because 10 / 2 = 5 with no remainder. 
	You can check if a number is divisible by another number by checking if x % y === 0.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: 99 Bottles of Juice (4-2)
 *
 * Use the following `while` loop to write out the song "99 bottles of juice".
 * Log the your lyrics to the console.
 *
 * Note
 *   - Each line of the lyrics needs to be logged to the same line.
 *   - The pluralization of the word "bottle" changes from "2 bottles" to "1 bottle" to "0 bottles".
 
	***Directions:
	Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.

	99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
	98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
	...
	2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
	1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!
	Some Notes:

	Note the pluralization of the word "bottle" when you go from 2 bottles to 1 bottle.
	Your text editor may try to autocorrect your ellipses ... to the ellipses character … Do not use the ellipses character for this quiz.

	4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 4!=4*3*2*1=24
	5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 5!=5*4*3*2*1=120

	Save your final answer in a variable called solution and print it to the console.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Find my Seat (4-8)
 * 
 * Write a nested for loop to print out all of the different seat combinations in the theater.
 * The first row-seat combination should be 0-0 
 * The last row-seat combination will be 25-99
 * 
 * Things to note: 
 *  - the row and seat numbers start at 0, not 1
 *  - the highest seat number is 99, not 100
