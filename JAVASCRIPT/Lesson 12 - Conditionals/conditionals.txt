/*
 * Programming Quiz: Even or Odd (3-2)
 *
 * Write an if...else statement that prints `even` if the 
 * number is even and prints `odd` if the number is odd.
 *
 * Note - make sure to print only the string "even" or the string "odd"
	***Directions:
	* Write an if...else statement that:

	* prints "even" if the number is an even number
	* prints "odd" if the number is an odd number
	* Hint: Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. 
	* The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:

	console.log(12 % 3);
	console.log(10 % 4);

	* Result: 
	* 0 
	* 2

	* The answer for 12 % 3 is 0 because twelve divided by three has no remainder. 10 % 4 is 2 because ten divided by 4 has a remainder of two.

	* Make sure to test your code with different values. For example:
	* If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
	* If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.
 */

// change the value of `number` to test your if...else statement
var number = 73;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("even");
} else {

 * Programming Quiz: Musical Groups (3-3)
	***Directions:
	Write a series of conditional statements that:

	prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
	prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
	prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
	prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
	prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)
	***Directions:
	For this quiz, you're going to help solve a fictitious murder mystery that happened here at Udacity! 
	A murder mystery is a game typically played at parties wherein one of the partygoers is secretly, 
	and unknowingly, playing a murderer, and the other attendees must determine who among them is the 
	criminal. It's a classic case of whodunnit.

	Since this might be your first time playing a murder mystery, we've simplified things quite a bit
	to make it easier. Here's what we know! In this murder mystery there are:

	four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
	four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
	and four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
	We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...

	the poison belongs to the ballroom,
	the trophy belongs to the gallery,
	the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
	and the knife belongs to the dining room.
	And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.

	Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
	Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
	Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
	Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
	To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:

	sets the value of weapon based on the room and
	sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
	Afterwards, print the following to the console if the mystery was solved:
	__________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
	Fill in the blanks with the name of the suspect, the room, and the weapon. For example,

	Mr. Parkes did it in the dining room with the knife!
	TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

	If room equals gallery and suspect equals Ms. Van Cleve, then Ms. Van Cleve did it in the gallery with the trophy! should be printed to the console.
 */

// change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test your code
var room = "dining room";
var suspect = "Mr. Parkes";

var weapon = "";
var solved = false;


if(room === "dining room" && suspect === "Mr. Parkes"){
    weapon = "knife";
    solved=true;
}else if (room === "billiards room" && suspect === "Mrs. Sparr"){
    weapon = "pool stick";
    solved=true;
}else if (room === "gallery" &&  suspect === "Ms. Van Cleve"){
    weapon = "trophy";
    solved=true;
} else if (room === "ballroom" &&  suspect === "Mr. Kalehoff"){
    weapon= "poison";
    solved=true;
}else{
    solved = false;
}

if(solved) {
    console.log(suspect + " did it in the " + room + " with the " + weapon + "!");

/*
 * Programming Quiz - Checking Your Balance (3-5)
	***Directions:
	Using the flowchart below, write the code to represent checking your balance at the ATM. 
	The yellow diamonds represent conditional statements and the blue rectangles with rounded 
	corners represent what should be printed to the console.
	Use the following variables in your solution:

	balance - the account balance
	isActive - if account is active
	checkBalance - if you want to check balance
	Hint: The variable balance could be a value less than, greater than, or equal to 0. 
	The variables isActive and checkBalance are booleans that can be set to true or false.

	TIP: To print out the account balance with decimal points (i.e. 325.00), use 
	the .toFixed() method and pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. 
	For example, balance.toFixed(2) returns 325.00.

	TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,
	If checkBalance equals true and isActive equals false, then Your account is no
	longer active. should be printed to the console.
	 */

// change the values of `balance`, `checkBalance`, and `isActive` to test your code
var balance = 325.00;
var checkBalance = true;
var isActive = false;

if(!checkBalance){

 * Programming Quiz: Ice Cream (3-6)
 *
 * Write a single if statement that logs out the message:
 * 
 * "I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________."
 * 
 * ...only if:
 *   - flavor is "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *   - vessel is "cone" or "bowl"
 *   - toppings is "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 *
 * We're only testing the if statement and your boolean operators. 
 * It's okay if the output string doesn't match exactly.
	*** Directions:
	Ice cream is one of the most versatile desserts on the planet because it can be done up so many
	different ways. Using logical operators, write a series of complex logical expressions 
	that prints only if the following conditions are true:

	if flavor is set to vanilla or chocolate and
	if vessel is set to cone or bowl and
	if toppings is set to sprinkles or peanuts
	If the above conditions are true, then print out:

	I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________.
	Fill in the blanks with the flavor of the ice cream, vessel, and toppings. For example,

	I'd like two scoops of vanilla ice cream in a cone with peanuts.
	TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

	If flavor equals "chocolate", vessel equals "cone" and toppings equals "sprinkles", 
	then "I'd like two scoops of chocolate ice cream in a cone with sprinkles." 
	should be printed to the console.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: What do I Wear? (3-7)
	***Directions:
	Use the sizing chart above, create a series of logical expressions that prints the size 
	of a t-shirt based on the measurements of shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve. 
	Valid sizes include S, M, L, XL, 2XL, and 3XL.

	For example, if...

	var shirtWidth = 23; // size L (large)
	var shirtLength = 30; // size L (large)
	var shirtSleeve = 8.71; // size L (large)
	Then print L to the console.

	Hint: You will need to compare a range of values when checking for shirtWidth, shirtLength, 
	and shirtSleeve. For example, if the shirt's width is at least 20", but no more than 22", 
	then the t-shirt should be medium (M) — as long as the other values for the shirt's length 
	and sleeve measurements match up.

	If shirtWidth, shirtLength, and shirtSleeve don't fit within the range of acceptable values 
	for a specific size, then print N/A to the console. For example, if...

	var shirtWidth = 18; // size S (small)
	var shirtLength = 29; // size M (medium)
	var shirtSleeve = 8.47; // size M (medium)
	Then print N/A to the console because the measurements don't all match up with one particular size.

	TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,

	If shirtWidth equals 19, shirtLength equals 28 and shirtSleeve equals 8.21, then S should be printed to the console.
	If shirtWidth equals 26, shirtLength equals 33 and shirtSleeve equals 9.63, then 2XL should be printed to the console.
	If shirtWidth equals 18, shirtLength equals 29 and shirtSleeve equals 8.47, then N/A should be printed to the console.
