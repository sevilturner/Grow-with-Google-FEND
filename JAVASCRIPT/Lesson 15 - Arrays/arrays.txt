	Create an array called crew to organize the Serenity’s crew and set it equal to the variables below . You don't need to type out the actual strings, just use the provided variables.

	var captain = "Mal";
	var second = "Zoe";
	var pilot = "Wash";

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Colors of the Rainbow (6-4)
	***Directions:
	James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

	var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];
	but James had this:

	var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
	Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:

	Remove "Blackberry"
	Add "Yellow" and "Green"
	Add "Purple"
 */

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Joining the Crew (6-6)
	***Directions:
	In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Mal’s crew from the hit show Firefly.

	var captain = "Mal";
	var second = "Zoe";
	var pilot = "Wash";
	var companion = "Inara";
	var mercenary = "Jayne";
	var mechanic = "Kaylee";

	var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
	Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

	var doctor = "Simon";
	var sister = "River";
	var shepherd = "Book";
 */

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 *
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
	***Directions:
	Use the array's forEach() method to loop over the following array and add 100 to each of the values if the value is divisible by 3.

	var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4, 19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299, 6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139];
	Remember that the "Test Run" button will display any logged content, so feel free to use console.log() to test your code.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: I Got Bills (6-9)
 *
 * Use the .map() method to take the bills array below and create a second array
 * of numbers called totals. The totals array should contains each amount from the
 * bills array but with a 15% tip added. Log the totals array to the console.
 *
 * For example, the first two entries in the totals array would be:
 *
 * [57.76, 21.99, ... ]
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - each entry in the totals array must be a number
 *  - each number must have an accuracy of two decimal points
	***Directions:
	Use the map() method to take the array of bill amounts shown below, and create a 
	second array of numbers called totals that shows the bill amounts with a 15% tip added.

	var bills = [50.23, 19.12, 34.01, 100.11, 12.15, 9.90, 29.11, 12.99, 10.00, 99.22, 102.20, 100.10, 6.77, 2.22];
	Print out the new totals array using console.log.

	TIP: Check out the toFixed() method for numbers to help with rounding the values to a 
	maximum of 2 decimal places. Note, that the method returns a string to maintain the 
	"fixed" format of the number. So, if you want to convert the string back to a number, 
	you can cast it or convert it back to a number:

	Number("1");
	Returns: 1
