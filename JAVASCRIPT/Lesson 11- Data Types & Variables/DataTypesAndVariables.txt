	*Build a string using concatenation by combining the lines from this famous haiku poem by Yosa Buson.
	* Blowing from the west
	* Fallen leaves gather
	* In the east.
	* Each string should be printed on its own line.

 * Programming Quiz: Semicolons! (2-8)
	*** Directions:
	* Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values. 
	* Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation. 
	* For example: red blue where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue"

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Out to Dinner (2-10)
	*** Directions:
	* Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 
	* (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!). 
	* Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying
	* bill by a 15% tip rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store 
	* it into a variable called total.

	* Print the total to the JavaScript console.
	* Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15.
	* TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. 
	* To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method. 
	* To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. 
	* For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.
